# kmax
Emacs Enhancements for Symbolic Knowledge Manipulation Environment

KMax stands for Knowledge Maximum.

KMax contains several enhancements to Emacs.  There is the possibility of using existing Emacs or rewriting parts or all of it.  Example features include -Programming By Demonstration, +recording all sessions -(semantically), -remapping keys based on coding theory and mnemonics, opencyc-el integration, and an AI that uses KMax as the basis of its visual system.  All of these are partially complete except for the programaming by demonstration.

Kmax is derived via analogy to Emacs, and incorporates many techniques from AI.  It aims to borrow the innumerable, well tested features of Emacs, but also integrates a large repository of knowledge based tools into it, so that Kmax functions as an intelligent agent, making decisions and even reasoning about the psychology of the user.

Binding of keystrokes to functions.

Large, well organized library of functions.

Automatic optimization of the key layout, based on methods from coding theory.
